\chapter{FOBOS Overview}
\section{Introduction}
FOBOS is a Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) platform  that is flexible, open-source and includes tools needed for power data acqusition and analysis.
In this chapter, we briefly discuss FOBOS features. To get more details about any feature, please refer to the corresponding chapter in this document.

\section{Hardware Setup}
FOBOS hardware consist of the following components:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The control board (A standard FPGA board)
  \item The DUT board (A standard FPGA board). This board hosts the DUT Wrapper and the DUT.
  \item An oscilloscope (Agilent DSO6054A) 
  \item Power supply 
  \item Clock generator
  \item Control PC
  \item Current probe
\end{enumerate}

FOBOS control and DUT boards are standard FPGA boards that need to be configured. FOBOS control board hardware description is provided along with a DUT wrapper. However, DUT is user provided.
FPGA boards need to be connected to other components. For details, please refer to Chapter~ \ref{chap:dut-dev} and Chapter~ \ref{chap:hardware-config}.

\section{Trace Acquisition}
After FOBOS software and hardware are prepared, operations (e.g. encryptions) can be run on the DUT board and traces collected.
This process is called Data Acquisition.
To run Data Acquisition, user must prepare test vectors, configure FOBOS and run the Data Acquisition script.
Data Acquisition will send test vectors to FOBOS hardware and traces will be collected form the oscilloscope. For more information about this, please refere to Chapter~ \ref{chap:dataAcquisition}
 
\section{Data Analysis}
FOBOS comes with multiple analysis modules including:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Correlation Power Analysis (CPA). See  Chapter ~ \ref{chap:fobos-cpa} for more information.
 \item Leakage Assesment Using Welch's T-Test. See Chapter ~ \ref{chap:fobos-t-test} for more information.
 \item Time domain analysis that maps trace samples to internal DUT state (FOBOS Profiler). See Chapter~ \ref{chap:fobos-profiler} for more information.
\end{enumerate}
